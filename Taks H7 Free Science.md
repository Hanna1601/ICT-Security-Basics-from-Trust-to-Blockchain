# H7 Free Science
> Homework for task  H7

It was quite hard to find article and then search the journal / publication in Jufo. So I ended up searching across, then found publications from Jufo and found interesting article thru their site and also the same on in Google Scholar. 
* I found research paper published in IEEE Security & Privacy that got JUFO rating 2
* Paper was publishes 4.4.2024

## Read and Summarize
> Generative AI for Cyber Security: Analyzing the Potential of ChatGPT, DALL-E, and Other Models for Enhancing the Security Space

<sub>The article was quite long so my writing is based on skimming.</sub>

* The paper looks into using Generative AI (later GAI) and how it can be used in cybersecurity, as the threats are increasing and getting more sophisticated and frequent.
* GAI technology offers an effective way to address cybersecurity challenges in an automated way, increasing efficiency and letting humans use their time on more critical security aspects.
* GAI systems are better at detecting new malware and threatening situations compared to humans.
* Tech companies like Google and Microsoft are incorporating GAI elements into their cybersecurity systems, resulting in tools such as Google Cloud Security AI Workbench and Microsoft Security Copilot.
* These GAI systems aren't without their limitations, like costly training, giving wrong results and potential of GAI being used by malicious actors,. 

Where has GAI been used in the field of security?
* Password protection, simulated environments, social media threat hunting, data privacy protection, vulnerability scanning and filtering.
    * In simulated environments with the help of GAI one can simulate threatening environments to mirror real-world situations, which helps to identify and handle these threats and also evaluate the effectiveness of their security systems.
    * Some use cases of simulated environments are simulated attacks, malware and intrusion detection, creating honeypots, phishing resilience training and syntehetic threat generation.

The limitations
While GAI can provide useful tools for cybersecurity, it still doesn't come without its problems.

* Wrong or unethical results: long term effects are not seen yet, which causes risks that we are not still even aware of. 
* Cost inefficiency: To get and maintain GAI in field of cyber security it requires money and intellectual property which isn't available for every company
* High setup time: Models take quite some time to train
* Easy exploitability by malicious actors: Malicious actors can use this to develop malware, they can also exploit it to identify attack vectors that reveal unauthorized access points easily
* Interpretabilit and explainability: It is hard to interpret or explain the results given by GAI systems, as the architecture of models is complex. 
* Contextual limitations: GAI models can have challenges understanding context, which can lead in irrelevant output. 
* Difficulty with lon-range dependencies: When generating long sequences the models have difficulty to maintain coherence and consistency. This may lead to output that is fragmented or incoherent. 
* Data-related concerns: GAI tools can pose a risk to data privacy. These can be data breaches, inadequate anonymization, biases and discrimination, lack of consent and transparensy and inadaquate data retention and deletion practises
* Lack of control: The outputs of GAI can be out of the users control, this can be shown more in screnarios wehere to models generate content in an autonomous and unsupervised manner.
* Need for empirical evaluation: There is no standarized way to evaluate the GAI-models

## A - create alert

I tested to create an alert to Google Scholar. At the point of writing I am not sure how this is working, I think we will see.
